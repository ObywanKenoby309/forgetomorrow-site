  <h1>About ForgeTomorrow</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We’re building the next evolution in professional networking—human-centered, AI-empowered, and built for the real world.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to equip job seekers, freelancers, recruiters, mentors, and ethical employers with the tools and transparency they need to succeed in today’s fast-changing job market.</p>
    <p><strong>No gatekeeping. No noise.</strong> Just support that shows up, AI with integrity, and a network where people come before algorithms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>ForgeTomorrow started because we were tired of the gatekeeping and poor support from other famous sites. We listened closely to the struggles faced by professionals at every level — from those just starting their job search and struggling to afford networking tools, to senior C-suite executives wanting to stay connected and informed in the fast-evolving professional landscape.</p>
    <p>Just because you can’t pay for top-tier services doesn’t mean you shouldn’t receive assistance. We’ve seen too many talented people lost to the struggle — I personally read about a user who committed suicide because he simply gave up. Others wander without help or direction. That shouldn’t be how it is.</p>
    <p>As people and professionals across IT, HR, employers, coaches, and beyond, we can do better to support job seekers. Everyone has a role to play — and we believe this is that opportunity to build something truly meaningful.</p>
    <p>Many current platforms have fallen short of meeting the needs of individuals seeking meaningful support and connection, focusing too much on popularity and paid access rather than real help.</p>
    <p>ForgeTomorrow is built to fill that gap — to be a place where everyone can find real tools, real help, and real connection, no matter their budget or status.</p>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human-Centered</strong><br>We prioritize real people over algorithms. Every feature and decision is designed to support meaningful human connection and empower users at every stage of their journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency & Integrity</strong><br>We believe in openness and honesty. Users deserve clear, trustworthy tools and communications without hidden agendas or gatekeeping.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Hiring & Opportunity</strong><br>We commit to fostering fair, bias-free hiring processes and creating opportunities for all, regardless of background or resources.</li>
      <li><strong>AI with Purpose</strong><br>Our AI tools serve to assist, not replace, human judgment—providing actionable insights while respecting privacy and individual dignity.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Empowerment</strong><br>ForgeTomorrow is a platform built by and for its users. We encourage mentorship, collaboration, and shared success across all professional levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility & Affordability</strong><br>Everyone deserves access to professional growth tools. We strive to keep our platform affordable and inclusive to support the widest possible audience.</li>
    </ul>
