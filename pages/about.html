    <h1>About ForgeTomorrow</h1>
    <p>ForgeTomorrow started because we were tired of the gatekeeping and poor support from other famous sites. We listened closely to the struggles faced by professionals at every level — from those just starting their job search and struggling to afford networking tools, to senior C-suite executives wanting to stay connected and informed in the fast-evolving professional landscape.</p>
    <p>Just because you can’t pay for top-tier services doesn’t mean you shouldn’t receive assistance. We’ve seen too many talented people lost to the struggle — I personally read about a user who committed suicide because he simply gave up. Others wander without help or direction. That shouldn’t be how it is.</p>
    <p>As people and professionals in the market, everyone from IT, HR, employers, and coaches can do better to help the seeker — and we should. This is that opportunity.</p>
    <p>Many current platforms have fallen short of meeting the needs of individuals seeking meaningful support and connection, focusing too much on popularity and paid access rather than real help.</p>
    <p>ForgeTomorrow is built to fill that gap — to be a place where everyone can find real tools, real help, and real connection, no matter their budget or status.</p>
